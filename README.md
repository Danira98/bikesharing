# Bike Sharing : Working with Tableau

## Overview of Project

### Overview:
In this project, we are given the task to create an analysis and visualization of bike sharing, specifically Citi bike data, centered in New York. We are instructed to carry on this analysis to help create a well-rounded business proposal to carry on a similar bike sharing option in the city of Des Moines, Iowa. In order to create stories to present in our Tableau page, we will create dashboards and worksheets that gives us insight about the users that use this service during the month of August.

### Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis is to showcase information about the users of the bike sharing option in the city of New York,  and presenting a cohesive report that will visualize the information needed to make a final decision on whether it would be ideal to invest in a bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. This report will include visualizations that answer the following questions:

- How many trips were taken in the month of August?
- What is the annual breakdown of short-term customers versus annual subscribers?
- What are the peak hours of bike rentals?
- What are the most traveled locations?
- What is the Gender breakdown of users?
- What is the average ride duration?
- What are the prime hours for bike repairs?

After creating our worksheets and Dashboards, we were able to create multiple stories that gave us a well-rounded report of our data.

- Top starting locations: Our first visualization shows us which locations are most popular amongst the users. The darker the blue dot, the more popular our location. After some research, we found that the most popular starting location amongst tourist is Manhattan.

- Peak Hours and Prime Hours for repairs: The next visualization shows us the distribution of users per hour of the day. The Peak hours for users is between the hours of 4:00-7:00 pm. The slowest hours are between 2:00-4:00 am, which means that these hours would be ideal to do bike repair since it will not interfere with a large quantity of the customers.

- Average trip duration demographic based on age:
 The graph below showcases that users of the age of 53 , followed by the range of ages 22-26 are the ages with the highest average Trip duration during the month of August.

 - Check Out times per User and Gender:
The following graphs showcase that there is a significant difference between the amount of Male bikes versus Female bikers. In general, there is a higher amount of male bikers than female bikers, but female bikers tend to be more consistent throughout the trip durations.

## Summary
     
Our visualizations will help create a business proposal to persuade investors to consider this program to be a successful investment in the future. From the visualizations generated, we can see that this program will be most successful with men and especially after working hours. Moreover, users that had a subscription used the bikes at a higher rate than short term customers. It would be ideal to create prices where it would be more affordable to have a subscription than to use daily passes so more users will subscribe to the program. To get more insight on our users, we can create an additional visualization that shows the distribution of the Average trip duration per ages, and add gender to our filter to see which ages would be ideal to target to increase profit. Lastly, we can include visualization of what are the most popular starting locations and ending locations. Based on what we find, we can do additional research to figure out what factors come into play to for these locations to be as popular as they are, i.e businesses around it, tourist monuments, parks, etc.
