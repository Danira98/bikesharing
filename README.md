# Bike Sharing : Working with Tableau

## Overview of Project

### Overview:
In this project, we are given the task to create an analysis and visualization of bike sharing, specifically Citibike data, centered in New York. We are instructed to carry on this analysis to help create a well rounded business proposal to carry on a similar bike sharing option in the city of Des Moines,Iowa. In order to create stories to present in our Tableau page, we will create dashboards and worksheets that gives us insignt about the users that use this service during the month of August.

### Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis is to showcase information about the users of the bike sharing option in the city of New York, and presenting a cohesive report that will visualize the information needed to make a final decision on whether it would be ideal to invest in a bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. This report will include visualizations that answer the following questions:
